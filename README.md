## nshmp-haz

U.S. Geological Survey ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov)) National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project ([NSHMP](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/)) code for performing probabilistic seismic hazard (PSHA) and related analyses. These codes are intended for use with seismic hazard models developed by the NSHMP for the U.S. and its territories.

**Note:** This project recently adopted the [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system and underwent a major refactoring. We recommend that previous users of the source code check out a fresh copy and migrate any modifications.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz/wiki/) for more information.
