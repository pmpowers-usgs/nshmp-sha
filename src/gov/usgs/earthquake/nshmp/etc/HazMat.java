  /*
   * Developer notes:
   * 
   * Mathworks has gone out of its way to make it more and more difficult to use
   * Java in Matlab as time goes on, despite it being a first-class citizen.
   * Specifically, the Matlab classpath includes a dizzying number of 3rd party
   * libraries, many of which are now well out of date. The problem posed to
   * nshmp-haz is the inclusion of v.15 of Google Guava (this, one can only
   * determine by unpacking the included google-collections.jar as they haven't
   * bothered to update the name of the dependency) whereas the current Guava
   * release is v.23. The aggressive deprecation and removal of bad, unused, or
   * superceeded code by Google has resulted in significant class and method
   * variations within Guava over 8 update cycles. nshmp-haz will not remove
   * it's dependency on Guava, but putting nshmp-haz early on the Matlab
   * classpath causes Matlab to crash as it can't find (now missing) methods in
   * Guava.
   * 
   * The unsatisfactory but functional workaround is to use a custom class
   * loader that, once we want to use nshmp-haz classes, scans nshmp-haz.jar
   * before looking in the matlab classpath. This approach is messy in that the
   * sole point of entry is this class, which delegates to HazMatHelper (loaded
   * with the custom class loader) and the methods of which must be accessed via
   * reflection.
   * 
   * Note that if nshmp-haz moves to Java 8, which will probably occur sooner
   * rather than later, the custom class loader will also have to have Java 8 on
   * it's classpath. Sigh.
